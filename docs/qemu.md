### Download and install QEMU

Stefan Weil provides executable binaries (=installers) for Windows, supporting either 32-bit or 64-bit systems. Choose the corresponding link for your system and download the latest ".exe" of the root directory.

Download the 32-bit version [here](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/)

Download the 64-bit version [here](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/)

After downloading, open and install QEMU in the default path (```C:\Program Files\qemu```). Also, leave all checkboxes checked when prompted in the additional package list while running the installer.
